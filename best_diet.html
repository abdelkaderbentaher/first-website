    <h2>What's the right diet for you?</h2>
    <h4>
      Do you struggle with your weight and wonder which diet would give you the
      best results?
    </h4>
    <p>
      On What's The Right Diet For You? A Horizon Special, we profiled 75 people
      to understand why they had problems losing weight. <br />
      Medical and nutritional experts tested their hormones, genes and attitudes
      towards food, <br />
      categorising them into three groups: <br />
      Constant Cravers, Feasters and Emotional Eaters. <br />
      Our experts then gave each group a different diet to follow, using a
      scientific approach to weight loss. <br />
      This test will indicate whether you may be in one of the groups. <br />
      It is not a substitute for tests performed in the experiment but it is a
      useful guide that you can use at home.
